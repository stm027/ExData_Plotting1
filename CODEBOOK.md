#The plot1 function imports data from "household_power_consumption.txt", 
#subsets it by date, and creates a .png histogram of Global Active Power

#The plot2 function imports data from "household_power_consumption.txt", 
#subsets it by date, and creates a .png line graph 
#of a date/time variable vs. Global Active Power

#The plot3 function imports data from "household_power_consumption.txt", 
#subsets it by date, and creates a .png plot of
  #A date/time variable vs. Three Submetering variables

#The plot4 function imports data from "household_power_consumption.txt", 
#subsets it by date, and creates a .png plot with four graphs
#1. A date/time variable vs. Global Active Power
#2. A date/time variable vs. Voltage
#3. A date/time variable vs. Three Submetering variables
#4. A date/time variable vs. Global Reactive Power
